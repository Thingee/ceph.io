This Friday, Ceph is participating as a [featured project](https://anitab-org.github.io/open-source-day/featured/#Ceph) in [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org)'s [Open Source Day](https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/) (OSD), an all-day hack-a-thon during the [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in which participants of all levels can contribute and learn about Open Source.

Involvement from the Ceph developer community is encouraged and welcome! Here are some ways you can get involved on the day of the event (**Friday, September 16th, 8am to 3pm PT**):

1. You will see an influx of GitHub pull requests with the label [open-source-day-2022](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aopen-source-day-2022+).
2. Any reviews/feedback on these pull requests are welcome, especially on components other than RADOS (Neha Ojha, Yaarit Hatuka, Girjesh Rajoria, Deepika Upadhyay, and I will be facilitating the RADOS/core reviews).
3. See the current list of ["low-hanging-fruit" Trackers](https://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=status_id&op%5Bstatus_id%5D=%3D&v%5Bstatus_id%5D%5B%5D=1&f%5B%5D=issue_tags&op%5Bissue_tags%5D=%3D&v%5Bissue_tags%5D%5B%5D=low-hanging-fruit&f%5B%5D=tracker_id&op%5Btracker_id%5D=%21&v%5Btracker_id%5D%5B%5D=6&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=project&c%5B%5D=tracker&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=updated_on&c%5B%5D=category&c%5B%5D=fixed_version&c%5B%5D=cf_3&group_by=&t%5B%5D=), which the Open Source Day participants will be working from.
4. If you know of any non-documentation, easier issues (e.g. code cleanups, logging, simple bugs, small features) that you would like OSD participants to work on, please feel free to tag/create these issues with the "low-hanging-fruit" tag!

You can reach out to me at <lflores@redhat.com> if you have any questions about the event or how to get involved.

Special thanks to Ambika Sharma, Anna Jung, and everyone else at [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org) for having Ceph as a featured project.

Special thanks also to Neha Ojha, Yaarit Hatuka, Girjesh Rajoria, and Deepika Upadhyay, who will be working alongside myself as Open Source Day project representatives and mentors.
