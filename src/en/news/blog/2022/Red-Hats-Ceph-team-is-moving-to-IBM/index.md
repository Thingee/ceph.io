Today IBM and Red Hat announced some big news related to Ceph: the Ceph storage
team at Red Hat is moving to IBM [1]. This is a joint IBM/Red Hat decision, and
represents a large investment in the continued growth and health of Ceph and
its community.

This is great news for upstream Ceph! Our project’s governance model and
operation stays the same. Ceph continues to be 100% open-source, and IBM will
continue to contribute with an upstream-first approach.

IBM recognizes the success of Ceph is due to its vibrant community and shares
our vision of a broad, collaborative open source project. IBM will assume Red
Hat’s sponsorship of the Ceph Foundation and help support Ceph’s upstream test
lab. 

We are incredibly excited about this new milestone for Ceph, and look forward
to this new chapter. Ceph has come a long way from Sage Weil’s PhD project.
Ceph is used in thousands of production clusters totalling several exabytes of
data today, and is the leading open source software-defined storage solution.
Since 2004, the Ceph project has envisioned transforming the storage industry
to rely on fully open source software, and this is a great endorsement and
realization of this transformation. 

We are very thankful to everyone who has contributed to Ceph’s success over the
years and moving forward. Our commitment to developing robust, scalable, open
storage platforms continues, and we look forward to the future of storage, with
a renewed interest in large-scale bare metal clusters. Together, let’s keep
pushing the boundaries of storage!
