After a long journey to Germany, the Ceph team were welcomed with open arms by the service provider community.

We met some wonderful people who had a lot of great opinions of Ceph and some that had just learned of the capabilities that Ceph has to offer.

We like to work hard here at Ceph â€“ but some like to work harder than others as you can see below
