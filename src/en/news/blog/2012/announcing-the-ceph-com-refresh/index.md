Hello, everyone! I’m the new community guy for Ceph, and it’s my honor to announce the refresh of our website.

Today is a big day for all of us because Inktank has just launched. Inktank’s mission is to provide professional services and support for users of Ceph, but it goes a lot deeper; Inktank is dedicated to the success of the Ceph project and will ensure that it has the resources it needs to succeed.

I came to work at Inktank because we all believe in Ceph, we believe in the community process, and we have no interest in being a traditional software company hiding behind an open source marketing strategy. Ceph belongs to us all, and Inktank will earn its success through the quality of the service it provides.

The new Ceph.com site is a bit more modern, a lot more dynamic, and (hopefully) a bit easier to navigate.

It’s not perfect, but it gives us tons of room to grow. Very soon (within days), we’ll be releasing a major documentation rewrite to help new users get up to speed with Ceph. We’ve been looking into more advanced community metrics, project testing stats, and tighter integration between tools.

We’re just getting started! We’d love to hear from you. If you have any thoughts on the new site, let us know in the comments below.

Best,  
Ross
