We’ve released v0.24, just in time for the holidays!  Big changes this time around include:

- mds: many fixes with clustered failure recovery
- mds: bloom filter to reduce directory reads
- mds: configurable directory hash functions (for fragmentation)
- rbd: import/export tools are smart about holes (i.e., use FIEMAP)
- osd: many recovery improvements, mostly making data available more quickly
- osd: automatic background scrubbing when load is low
- osd: fixes with dedicated backend replication network
- osd: use new (2.6.37) btrfs ioctls for async snapshot creation
- replaced openssl dependency with libcrypto++ (licensing issue)
- librados: “zero-copy” reads
- misc bug fixes, man pages, and code cleanup

The focus for the next release (v0.25) is on OSD and MDS stability, directory fragmentation recovery, and fsck preliminaries; see [the roadmap](http://tracker.newdream.net/projects/ceph/roadmap) for more details.
