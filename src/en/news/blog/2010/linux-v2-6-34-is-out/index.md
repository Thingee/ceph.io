Linux v2.6.34, which includes the Ceph kernel client, has been released!  This is an exciting milestone for us, and we’re pretty happy with the stability of the client code that made it into this release.  This should make it easier for people to experiment with Ceph and see how it holds up on a wide variety of systems.

Please note, however, that Ceph is still **experimental** and is not yet ready for use in a production environment.  We have made every effort to prevent the client from crashing your system, but it is still relatively young code.  The server side also has some known issues, and will need both time and testing to earn our trust.
