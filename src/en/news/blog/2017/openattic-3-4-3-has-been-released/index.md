We are happy to announce version 3.4.3 of openATTIC.

With the new feature development for openATTIC 3.x slowing down, this release is primarily focused on fixing bugs (e.g. an issue leading to error messages when deleting RBDs) and improving details in the existing functionality.

New features include the possibility to create RBDs with a dedicated data pool and to enable compression on Ceph pools stored on Bluestore OSDs. You can now change the password of a user via the openATTIC WebUI. We also added some new statistics for RBDs and Ceph Object Gateway (based on Grafana & Prometheus). We also updated the documentation and improved the usabillity of the UI in several areas. We have also worked on speeding up the loading of the list of RBDs by loading the data in parallel. In addition to that, this version also concludes the removal of support for Nagios/Icinga and PNP4Nagios.
