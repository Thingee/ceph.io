We're happy to announce version 3.6.0 of openATTIC.

Given the fact that openATTIC 3.5.3 was only a bug fix release this 3.6.0 release includes all the improvements and changes since 3.5.2. We cleaned up and removed a lot of unnecessary things and also made some usability improvements to the UI.

The most visible change in openATTIC 3.6.0 is the unification of Grafana and our "old" widgets into one single dashboard page.

We now have one unified dashboard and you don't have to switch between the "old" and the new Grafana dashboard. We included the functionality of the old status widget into our default dashboard. If your cluster is in an error or warning state, this will be shown at the top of your dashboard including the failure message from the 'ceph health' command.
