This week I will be attending [LibreCon 2017](https://librecon.io "LibreCon 2017"), one of the largest international events on open source technologies. It will be held on 19 and 20 October in [Santiago de Compostela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela "Santiago de Compostela") (Spain).

This year’s theme is the application of open source technologies in the industrial and primary sector, as well as the new opportunities that these technologies offer in areas like [Cloud Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud Computing"), [Big Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big Data"), Internet of Things (IoT) and the [Sharing Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy "Sharing Economy").

I will be delivering one talk, under the sponsorship of my company [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com "Igalia"), on [Ceph Object Storage](https://ceph.com "Ceph") and its [S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3 "Amazon S3") [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "API"). I will introduce the Ceph architecture and the basics to understand how make cloud storage products and services based on Ceph/[RGW](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/ "RadosGW"). I will also comment on the most useful and supported S3 API and tooling working with Ceph.

See you there!
