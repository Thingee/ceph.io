Happy New year! Bonne Année ! Best wishes to my readers :).

_C’est le turfu_ and Ceph is moving fast, really fast and you won’t believe how many awesome features are currently in the pipe. So to start the year off the wheels, I’m planning on publishing a set of articles to tease you a little bit. But don’t get to excited, this is on-going work that will mature next year only. Starting this week on Friday and all the following ones and for an undetermined period of time. See you this Friday for the first blog post!
