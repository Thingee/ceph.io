It is our great pleasure to announce Version 3.6.1 of openATTIC.

3.6.1 is a bugfix release for the 3.6 stable branch, containing fixes for multiple issues that were reported by users.

In addition to that, it contains several usability enhancements and security improvements.

Behind the scenes, we continued with converting the WebUI code into Angular components in preparation for moving to Angular 2 in the near future.

Note that this release depends on a [DeepSea](https://github.com/SUSE/DeepSea) version 0.8.2 or higher, as one improvement to the iSCSI target management ([OP-2926](https://tracker.openattic.org/browse/OP-2926)) required making changes to both openATTIC and DeepSea.
