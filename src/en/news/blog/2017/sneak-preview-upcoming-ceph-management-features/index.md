Despite the number of disruptive changes that we went through in the past few weeks, e.g. [moving our code base from Mercurial to git](/posts/openattic-code-repository-migrated-to-git/), relocating our infrastructure to a new data center, [refactoring our code base for version 3.0](/posts/implementing-a-more-scalable-storage-management-framework-in-openattic-30/), our developers have been busy working on expanding the Ceph management capabilities in openATTIC.

I'd like to highlight two of them that are nearing completion and should land in the master branch shortly.
