We are happy to announce version 3.4.4 of openATTIC.

Starting with Ceph "Luminous", all pools need to be associated to the application using the pool. With this release, we have introduced the possibility to manage these associations in our frontend and enable you to use Cephs' own pre-defined applications as well as creating your own ones. The edit functionality is still in the works, but didn't make it into this release. It will be included in the next one.

We have also fixed a few bugs related to the communication with DeepSea and decoupled a few requirements. Hence, the OSDs, RBDs and the Pools tab can now be used without having to use DeepSea.

Additionally, we have further enhanced the functionality of our WebUI by allowing to modify existing Ceph Object Gateway user capabilities.
