A bit over a month ago, I posted about a few [new Ceph management features](/posts/sneak-preview-upcoming-ceph-management-features/) that we have been working on in openATTIC 3.x after we finished [refactoring the code base](/posts/implementing-a-more-scalable-storage-management-framework-in-openattic-30/).

These have been merged into the trunk in the meanwhile, and the team has started working on additional features. In this post, I'd like to give you an update on the latest developments and share some screen shots with you.
