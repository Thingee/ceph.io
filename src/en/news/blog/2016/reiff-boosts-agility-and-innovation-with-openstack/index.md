## Virtualization for DevOps agility

To REIFF, virtualization technology is key to DevOps agility, as dictated by the company's desire to innovate across the supply chain, constantly improve efficiency, and enhance customer experience. Cloud technology comes as a natural fit, adding fully developer-driven self-service capacity for increasingly complex virtual infrastructure solutions.

## OpenStack and Ceph: highly available cloud and future-proof storage

In a multi-stage process involving first an exploratory [design workshop and architecture specification](https://www.hastexo.com/services/architecture/), then a proof-of-concept deployment, then a gradual [transition to production](https://www.hastexo.com/services/implementation/), hastexo assisted REIFF in rolling out a typical [OpenStack](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/openstack/) private cloud infrastructure across two data center locations. Providing full controller and storage redundancy and high availability, including proven technology like [Pacemaker](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/pacemaker/) and [Ceph](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/ceph/), REIFF was able to deploy an elastic, scalable cloud platform in a compressed timeframe.

hastexo will continue to assist REIFF in the deployment and optimization of open source cloud and software-defined storage technology.
