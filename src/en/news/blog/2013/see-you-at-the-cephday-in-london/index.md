> A quick post to tell everybody that I’ll be giving a presentation at the Ceph day in London. Obviously, I’ll be representing the company I work for, [eNovance](http://www.enovance.com/). The event is next Wednesday, October 9, 2013. I am going to talk about Ceph, performance and benchmarking. You can check the details and schedule of the event [here](http://cephdaylondon.eventbrite.com/). See you there!

**Update: slides available through my [employer’s blog (eNovance)](http://techs.enovance.com/6244/ceph-days-london-ceph-performance-slides).**
