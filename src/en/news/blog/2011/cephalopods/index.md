The name Ceph comes from [cephalopod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod), a class of mollusks that includes the octopus and squid.  The suggestion came from [Carlos Maltzahn](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~carlosm/UCSC/Home/Home.html), a professor in our research group at UCSC, sometime in 2006.  My memory is a bit hazy, but if memory serves the reasoning had something to do with their high level of intelligence and many-tentacled–ahem, “distributed”–physiology \[insert hand waving here\].

Here are some fun facts (and links).

- Cephalopods have the most complex nervous system of all the invertebrates.
- Some can fly up to 50m through the air, squirting water to help propel themselves.
- Most have a [chromatophores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore), colored pigments on their skin that are used for camouflage.  Check out [this incredible video clip](http://www.sciencefriday.com/videos/watch/10397) from Science Friday.
- Cephalopods have advanced vision, but most are color blind.
- They can detect gravity with [statocysts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statocyst).
- They have an ink sac that they squirt into the water to confuse predators.
- Most have no bones and can squeeze themselves through extremely small holes ([search youtube for ‘octopus escape’](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=octopus+escape&aq=f) for some crazy videos).

Amusingly, I was searching for a story I heard a while back about an octopus at an aquarium that would sneak out of its tank to steal fish/food from a nearby tank and then return home, but ended up on [this page on snopes](http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=24;t=001369;p=1) about the prevalence of the story.
