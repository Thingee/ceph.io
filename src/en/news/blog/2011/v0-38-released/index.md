It”s a week delayed, but v0.38 is ready.  The highlights:

- osd: some peering refactoring
- osd: “replay” period is per-pool (now only affects fs data pool)
- osd: clean up old osdmaps
- osd: allow admin to revert lost objects to prior versions (or delete)
- mkcephfs: generate reasonable crush map based on “host” and “rack” fields in \[osd.NN\] sections of ceph.conf
- radosgw: bucket index improvements
- radosgw: improved swift support
- rbd: misc command line tool fixes
- debian: misc packaging fixes (including dependency breakage on upgrades)
- ceph: query daemon perfcounters via command line tool

The big upcoming items for v0.39 are RBD layering (image cloning), [online casino gambling](http://www.7thcity.org/) further improvements to radosgw”s Swift support, and some monitor failure recovery and bootstrapping improvements.  We”re also continuing work on the automation bits that the [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/NewDreamNetwork/ceph-cookbooks) and [Juju](https://launchpad.net/canonical-ensemble) charms will use, and a [Crowbar barclamp](https://github.com/NewDreamNetwork/barclamp-ceph) was also just posted on github.  Several patches are still working their way into libvirt and qemu to improve support for RBD authentication.
