We’ve released v0.27.1. This includes a few bugfixes for v0.27, including

- mds: misc journaling and replay bugs
- mds: fixed –reset-journal
- cfuse: fixed device major/minor values
- conf: less noise to stdout
- osd: fixed file descriptor leak from fiemap operation

In short, nothing terribly earth shattering.  v0.28 is about a week away, and will include significant changes in the OSD peering code and more MDS clustering fixes.
