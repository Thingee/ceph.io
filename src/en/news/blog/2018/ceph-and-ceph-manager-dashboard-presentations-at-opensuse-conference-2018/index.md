Last weekend, the [openSUSE Conference 2018](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18) took place in Prague (Czech Republic). Our team was present to talk about [Ceph](https://ceph.com) and our involvement in developing the Ceph manager dashboard, which will be available as part of the upcoming Ceph "Mimic" release.

The presentations were held by [Laura Paduano](https://twitter.com/Laura_Paduano_) and [Kai Wagner](https://twitter.com/ImTheKai) from our team - thank you for your engagement! The openSUSE conference team did an excellent job in streaming and recording each session, and the resulting videos can already be viewed from [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTPc36dVg8Q&list=PL_AMhvchzBafCf25yjL6Dix_moddfGfEb).
