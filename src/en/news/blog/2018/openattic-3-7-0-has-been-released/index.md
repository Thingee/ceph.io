We're happy to announce version 3.7.0 of openATTIC!

Version 3.7.0 is the first bugfix release of the 3.7 stable branch, containing fixes for multiple issues that were mainly reported by users.

There has been an issue with self-signed certificates in combination with the RGW proxy which is now configurable. We also improved the openATTIC user experience and adapted some of our frontend tests in order to make them more stable.

As mentioned in our [last blog post](https://www.openattic.org/posts/openattic-362-has-been-released/) our team was working on a Spanish translation. We are very proud to have the translation included in this release. Thank you Gustavo for your contribution.

Another highlight of the release is then newly added RBD snapshot management. openATTIC is now capable to create, clone, rollback, protect/unprotect and delete RBD snapshots. In addition it is also possible to copy RBD images now. Furthermore the "pool edit" feature received a slight update: we implemented the option to set the "EC overwrite" flag when editing erasure coded pools.
