It actually happened exactly one week ago while I was on vacation: it's our great pleasure and honor to announce that we have reached our first milestone - the [initial Ceph Dashboard v2 pull request](http://openattic.org/posts/the-ceph-dashboard-v2-pull-request-is-ready-for-review/) has now been [merged](https://www.spinics.net/lists/ceph-devel/msg40361.html) into the upstream Ceph master git branch, so it will become part of the upcoming Ceph "Mimic" release!
