Iâ€™m simply relaying an article I reviewed and helped writting. It is reflecting my talk from the last OpenStack Summit in Berlin, you can [read it here](https://thenewstack.io/openstack-and-ceph-for-distributed-hyperconverged-edge-deployments/) Thanks to the author for capturing the essence of the talk.
