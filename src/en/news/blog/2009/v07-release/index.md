I’ve tagged a v0.7 release.  Probably the biggest change in this release (aside from the usual bug fixes and performance improvements) is the new start/stop and configuration framework.  Notably, the entire cluster configuration can be described by a single cluster.conf file that is shared by all nodes (distributed via scp or NFS or whatever) and used for mkfs, startup, and shutdown.

New in v0.7:

- smart osd ‘sync’ behavior
- osd bug fixes
- fast truncate strategy
- improved start/stop scripts
- new cluster configuration framework
