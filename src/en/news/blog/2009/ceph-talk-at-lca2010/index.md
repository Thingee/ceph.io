I’ll be giving [a talk on Ceph](http://www.lca2010.org.nz/programme/schedule/view_talk/50162?day=wednesday) at [linux.conf.au 2010](http://www.lca2010.org.nz/)!  (Oddly enough, it’s in New Zealand this year, but I’m not complaining.)  I’ve heard great things about LCA, and am looking forward to being there.

The talk will cover two general areas: Ceph’s RADOS object storage architecture, including some of its data processing features, and the distributed file system that’s built on top of it.  The goal is to make it useful for administrators interested in a scalable file system, and developers working on cloud computing applications in needof a scalable storage and computing platform.
