By now you’ve no doubt heard we were [acquired by Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/4/red-hat-to-acquire-inktank-provider-of-ceph) last month, so our coming-out party of sorts? This year’s [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/) in Atlanta. And boy, do we have a lot planned…

Not only will our executives be exhibiting at the Inktank booth (Booth E2), both Inktank and Red Hat speakers and customers will be presenting on topics to include storage considerations for OpenStack, Red Hat Storage Server integrations, and best practices for deploying Inktank Ceph.

Want more detail? Following’s an at-a-glance list of the activities we have planned. Please: Join us as we embark on our journey as part of the Red Hat family. It’s sure to be an exciting ride.
