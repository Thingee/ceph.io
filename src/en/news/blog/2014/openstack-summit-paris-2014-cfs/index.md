The Call for Speakers period for the [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-paris-summit-2014/) from 03. - 07.11.2014 in Paris ended this week. Now the voting for the submitted talks started and ends at 11:59pm CDT on August 6. (6:59 am CEST on 7. August).

  

I've submitted a talk to the storage track. The title is "Ceph Performance Analysis on Live OpenStack Platform". If you are interested to see my talk in Paris, I would appreciate if you would vote for the talk [here](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/performance-analysis-on-ceph-for-a-live-openstack-platform). You can find there also the abstract of the talk.

  

Two of my colleagues submitted also interesting talks. Marc Koderer submitted "[OpenStack QA in a nutshell](http://openstack%20qa%20in%20a%20nutshell/)" and Stefan Heuser submitted "[Telekom Deutschlands Approach to NFV](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/telekom-deutschlands-approach-to-nfv)" to the "Telco Strategies" track.
