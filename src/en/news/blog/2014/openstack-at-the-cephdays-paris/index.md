Save the date (September 18, 2014) and join us at the new edition of the Ceph Days in Paris. I will be talking about the new amazing stuff that happened during this (non-finished yet) Juno cycle. Actually I've never seen so many patch sets in one cycle :D. Things are doing well for Ceph in OpenStack! Deploying Ceph with Ansible will be part of the talk as well.

The full schedule is available, don't forget to [register to the event](http://ceph.com/cephdays/paris/).

  

> Hope to see you there!
