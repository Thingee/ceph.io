If you’re in Atlanta Sunday 11th, may 2014 evening, for the [OpenStack summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/) or any other reason, join us to celebrate the [OpenStack Icehouse](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Icehouse_Release_Schedule) release and the [Ceph Firefly](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/CDS/CDS_Firefly_%28Nov_2013%29) release. There will be both OpenStack and Ceph developers present and no presentations planned : it’s 100% informal ![:-)](http://dachary.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
