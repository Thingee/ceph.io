After learning there was an [API](http://dmsimard.com/2014/01/01/documentation-for-ceph-rest-api/) for Ceph, it was clear to me that I was going to write a client to wrap around it and use it for various purposes.

It is still a work in progress and I feel it is not complete and clean enough to publish on pypi yet but I invite you to take a look and tell me what you think !  
The client is available on Github under the Apache v2 license here: [https://github.com/dmsimard/python-cephclient](https://github.com/dmsimard/python-cephclient)
