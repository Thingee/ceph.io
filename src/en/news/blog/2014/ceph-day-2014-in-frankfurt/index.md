Back again on my blog ... as you may know I work since a while now on the topic of Cloud Storage and especially on [Ceph](http://ceph.com/). I didn't add new posts about this topic since a long time, but I plan to do so.

  

Today (2014-02-27) I'm in Frankfurt/M (Germany) to attend to the Ceph day.

There are several interesting talks/presentations on the [agenda](http://www.inktank.com/cephdays/frankfurt/) like "Best Practices with Ceph as Distributed, Intelligent, Unified Cloud Storage (Dieter Kasper, Fujitsu)" or "Ceph Performance & Optimization" (since I worked on this topic the last few months, I would like to see how others handled this challenge). I'm looking forward to meet again some of the Inktank guys I've worked with so far, some of my former SUSE colleagues and may some other Ceph community members.
