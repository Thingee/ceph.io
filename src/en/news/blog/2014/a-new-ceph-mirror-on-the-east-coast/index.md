I’m glad to announce that Ceph is now part of the mirrors [iWeb](http://iweb.com/) provides.

It is available in both IPv4 and IPv6 by:

- **http** on [http://mirror.iweb.ca/](http://mirror.iweb.ca/) or directly on [http://ceph.mirror.iweb.ca/](http://ceph.mirror.iweb.ca/)
    
- **rsync** on ceph.mirror.iweb.ca::ceph
    

The mirror provides 4 Gbps of connectivity and is located on the eastern coast of Canada, more precisely in Montreal, Quebec.

We feel this complements very well the principal ceph mirror at [ceph.com](http://ceph.com/) located on the west coast and the european mirror on [eu.ceph.com](http://eu.ceph.com/).

Feel free to give it a try and let me know if you see any problems !
