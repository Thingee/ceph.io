Many customers ask, “How do I best configure the hardware in my environment for Ceph?” Inktank is in a unique position to help answer this question, because we’ve been helping many customers evaluate and deploy Ceph into production environments for block and object storage at major financial institutions, large and small service providers, and public enterprises.

Ceph was designed to enable customers to build and maintain multi-petabyte-scale clusters while providing enterprise-level features. Unlike storage solutions from proprietary vendors with long hardware development cycles based on commodity components, customers can deploy Ceph on the latest and most cost-effective processor technologies appropriate for their environments and business requirements. This document provides general information about how to configure and tune your hardware-any hardware-to get the optimal performance from Ceph.
