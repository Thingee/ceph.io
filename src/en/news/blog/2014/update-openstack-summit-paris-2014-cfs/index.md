An update on my talk submission for the OpenStack summit this year in Paris: my speech about [Ceph performance analysis](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/performance-analysis-on-ceph-for-a-live-openstack-platform) was not chosen by the committee for the official agenda. 

  

But at least one piece of good news:Â Marc's [talk](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/openstack-qa-in-a-nutshell) will be part of the OpenStack QA track.
