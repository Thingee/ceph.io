![Quick and efficient Ceph DevStacking](http://sebastien-han.fr/images/devstack.png)

Recently I built a little repository on github/ceph where I put two files to help you building your DevStack Ceph.

`bash $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack $ git clone https://github.com/ceph/ceph-devstack.git $ cp ceph-devstack/local* devstack $ cd devstack $ ./stack.sh`

  

> Happy DevStacking!
