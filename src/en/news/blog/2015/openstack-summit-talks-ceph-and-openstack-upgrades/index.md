![OpenStack summit talks: Ceph and OpenStack upgrades](http://sebastien-han.fr/images/openstack-summit-vancouver.jpg)

Self promotion ahead :) For the next OpenStack summit I have submitted two talks.

The first one is about Ceph and OpenStack (yet again!), in this session Josh Durgin and I will be focusing on the roadmap around the integration of Ceph into OpenStack. People might think that we are almost done, this is not true, even if we achieve a really good coverage many things need to be addressed.

The next talk is about OpenStack upgrade, a particularly challenging one that I am working on with Cisco since it's from Ubuntu Precise Havana to RHEL7 Icehouse. Basically it's a migration **and** an upgrade. We already started this process, so John Dewey from Cisco and I would love to share our experience so far.
