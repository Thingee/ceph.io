I presented together with Sage Weil about "Storage security in a critical enterprise OpenStack environment" with focus on Ceph. You can find the slides at [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/dalgaaf/open-stacksummitvancouver-cephsecurity). There is also a video [available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zpfQjlhh8A) at the OpenStack YouTube channel.
