## **Ceph Meetup Helsinki , Finland 22nd Jan 2015**

  

It has been a good start to 2015. We the geeks of "Helsinki Metropolitan Area" express our sincere thanks to Red Hat Folks for arranging an unofficial "Ceph Day" sort of Ceph Meetup.

  

From my point of view expecting any event on CEPH in Finland , is like day dreaming. But hopefully not from now. 

  

Here is my presentation during the meetup. Hope you enjoy and learn something new out of it. **Read it carefully "There is something new for YOU"**
