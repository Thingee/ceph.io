[![](images/dost-logo-h40.png)](https://openstack-tage.de/static/openstacktag/gfx/dost-logo-h40.png)Next week, from 23.-24.06.2015, the "German OpenStack Days" ([Deutsche OpenStack Tage](https://openstack-tage.de/)) take place in Frankfurt. I will give a talk about "Ceph in a security critical OpenStack Cloud" on Wednesday.Â 

  

The presentations are conducted in German, so it's mainly interesting for German people. There are several OpenStack and also Ceph related talks on the schedule, including a work shop on Ceph. As far as I know there are still tickets available for the conference.
