The next OpenStack summit is planed to take place in Vancouver from 18 - 22 May 2015. The  "Call for Speakers" ended last week. The [vote for presentation](https://openstack.org/vote-vancouver/) period started today and will end 23. February, 23:00 UTC (00:00 CEST, [05:00 CST](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack/2015-February/011571.html)). 

  

This year I've submitted, together with Sage Weil, a talk to the "Cloud Security" track with the title: "[Storage security in a critical enterprise OpenStack environment](http://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver//Presentation/storage-security-in-a-critical-enterprise-openstack-environment)". The talk will provide insight into requirements for a secure setup and potential issues, pitfalls, and attack vectors against storage technologies used with an enterprise OpenStack cloud. We will present what Deutsche Telekom and Red Hat/Inktank, together with the community, are working on to build a security critical cloud with OpenStack and Ceph.

  

You can [vote](http://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/presentation/storage-security-in-a-critical-enterprise-openstack-environment), if you are interested to see our talk at the summit, every vote is highly welcome. You can find a full abstract at the voting [page](http://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/presentation/storage-security-in-a-critical-enterprise-openstack-environment).

  

My colleague Marc Koderer submitted this year two talks \[[1](http://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/presentation/manila-taking-open-stack-shared-storage-to-the-telco-cloud)\]\[[2](http://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/presentation/openstack-ha-for-nfv-what-does-it-mean)\]. These are unrelated to Ceph, but he will appreciate your votes for sure, if you are interested in them.
