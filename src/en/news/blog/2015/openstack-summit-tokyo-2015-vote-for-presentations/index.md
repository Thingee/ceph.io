As mentioned [before](http://blog.bisect.de/2015/07/openstack-summit-tokyo-call-for-speakers.html): then next OpenStack Summit will take place in Tokyo, Japan from 27-30 October 2015. The "Call for Speakers" ended some days ago and now the vote for presentation period started and will end 30. July, 11:59 PDT (31. July  6:59 UTC / 08:59 CEST). 

  

I've submitted for Toky two talks:

  

- "[99.999% available OpenStack Cloud - A builder’s guide](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4567)" - This talk will provide insight in how to build a highly available OpenStack cloud together with Ceph in a classical highly available data centers with e.g. two fire compartments and redundant infrastructure. The focus will be on failure scenarios and their impact on OpenStack and Ceph components, quorum devices you have to consider, strategies on how to ensure quorums and keep the cloud running, pitfalls and solutions.
- "[NFV orchestration powered by OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5744)" - This talk would be about existing OpenStack orchestration projects and how they can be used to manage a NFV Cloud, how they integrate, what is missing, and how to map these projects on the ETSI-NFV model.

You can [vote](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/), if you are interested to see my talks \[[1](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4567)\]\[[2](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5744)\] at the summit, every vote is highly welcome. You can find a full abstract at the voting page.

  

My colleague Ralf Trezeciak submitted also a NFV related [talk](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5950). He will appreciate your votes for sure, if you are interested in the presentation.

  

There is a long list of interesting Ceph related talks, simply use the search field on the voting page. I may provide a list in an additional post later.
