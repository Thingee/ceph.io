Who is we? In the context of a horizontal community, the word we has a different meaning than within not-for-profit organizations or companies. We are the individuals who have access to the resources that would enable them to modify how it is implemented. For instance, someone with access to the configuration of the web server can change the log retention policy. What information do we collect? We collect information from you when you register on our site and gather data when you participate in the community by reading, writing, and evaluating the content shared here.
