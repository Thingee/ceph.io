City Network, a leading global supplier of cloud services, announced today that the company has recruited Jim Johansson as Global Marketing Manager. The company offers its customers cloud services for IT infrastructure as well as productivity and collaboration tools, operates in a global market and is experiencing strong growth. In his role Jim will be responsible for growing the City Network brand in Sweden and abroad, focusing on expansion and growth.

Jim has extensive experience in driving growth for industries who are undergoing major transitions. His most recent role was Managing Director of a subsidiary, and General Manager of IoT at US-based SHAPE Technologies Group. He has previously held various positions in business development, sales and marketing with the telecom giant Telenor and the IT consultancy firm ELITS. Jim holds a M.Sc. in Business Administration from Växjö University.

“All organizations know that cloud services are the foundation of secure and sustainable digitalization, there are no alternatives and we have a unique position in this gigantic market. Our cloud services are built using open source, developed in Europe, for European organizations and managed by personnel with local security classification. With Jim joining our team, we will now ramp up our communication efforts and focus on educating more people about the advantages of using legal cloud services,” says Johan Christenson, CEO and founder of City Network.

Jim, who will be based at the company’s headquarters in Karlskrona, Sweden, will work with all parts of the company’s offering. City Network’s public cloud service City Cloud and the IT infrastructure service Compliant Cloud, for companies with stringent regulatory compliance and security requirements, are used by both companies and government authorities across Europe. To meet market demand, particularly from the public sector, the company recently launched a completely new office suite with built-in regulatory compliance. The service is called Compliant Office and includes all of the productivity and collaboration tools that modern organizations need in their everyday work – e-mail, team chat and document management with built-in regulatory compliance.

“I am delighted to join City Network. The company has a very interesting position as a challenger in a market with strong growth but that is also the subject of heated debate and strict regulation. I look forward to work with the team to strengthen the awareness of our offerings and our market position as the legal, European alternative built on open standards,” says Jim Johansson, Marketing Manager of City Network.
