This Ceph Trademark Use Policy (“Policy”) of Red Hat, Inc. on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries (“Red Hat”) sets out rules for proper use of Ceph trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, social media identifiers, or other distinctive brand features (“Ceph Marks”). This Policy only allows you to use a subset of the Ceph Marks (identified in the list below and referred to as “Listed Ceph Marks”) so long as such use complies with this Policy. Any use of the Ceph Marks must be in accordance with this Policy. Any use that does not comply with this Policy is not authorized.

“Ceph”

This list will be updated as necessary to reflect the Ceph Marks suitable for use pursuant to this Policy.

## INTRODUCTION

While this Policy is intended to protect Red Hat’s Ceph brand, Red Hat understands that members of the community must be able to identify their relationship with Ceph or refer to Ceph products or services. Red Hat does not hereby endorse any providers of other products or services or the content on their websites (each a “Site”). Red Hat cannot be identified or implied as making such an endorsement or being affiliated with any such product, service, Site or Site’s content unless expressly agreed to by Red Hat in a writing specifying the terms of any such endorsement or affiliation. The Ceph Marks cannot be associated with any material Red Hat deems objectionable.

Red Hat allows the Ceph Marks only to be used as set forth in this Policy and for the specific purposes for which Red Hat has given explicit permission in writing. Other than making use of the Ceph Marks as expressly permitted by this Policy, you may not use the Ceph Marks without first obtaining written permission from Red Hat.

When you use any of the Ceph Marks, you must always follow the Rules for Proper Usage in this Policy. In addition, Red Hat may provide you with written requirements on the size, typeface, colors, and other graphic characteristics of the Ceph Marks. You must implement and ensure your compliance with these requirements before using the Ceph Marks. If these requirements change, including any changes to this Policy, you must implement those changes within a commercially reasonable timeframe.

Questions about usage, and requests for clarification or permission, may be submitted to <tmlicense@redhat.com>.

## TRADEMARK BASICS

### WHAT IS A TRADEMARK?

A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or device (or a combination thereof) that identifies the goods or services of a person or company and distinguishes them from the goods and services of others. Trademarks exist to help consumers identify, and companies publicize, the source of products and services. A trademark assures consumers of consistent quality regarding those goods or services and aids in their promotion. When others use a company’s trademarks, consumers may become confused as to the source of products sold under that trademark.

#### Why is it important to use trademarks correctly?

Rights to a trademark can last indefinitely if the trademark owner continues to use the mark to identify its goods and services. If trademarks are not used properly, they may be lost and one of a company’s most important assets may lose all of its value. Rights may be lost not only because of a trademark owner’s improper use of the mark, but also through improper use of the trademark by the public.

#### “Fair Use” of Trademarks

We acknowledge and support your right to make “fair use” of the Ceph Marks, and do not mean to suggest with this Policy that our permission is required in such cases. We cannot, however, tell you categorically what will and will not qualify as a “fair use.”

## RULES FOR PROPER USAGE

### General:

- The Ceph Marks may not be used in any manner other than expressly authorized in a written agreement or as expressly permitted by this Policy.
- You must use Ceph Marks in accordance with this Policy. No other rights of any kind are granted hereunder by implication or otherwise.

#### Requirements for Use:

- If you are using a Ceph Mark, distinguish it from the surrounding text in some way. Capitalize the first letter; capitalize, bold, underline, or italicize the entire Ceph Mark; place the Ceph Mark in quotes; or use a different type style or font for the Ceph Mark than for the generic name.
- If you do not capitalize the entire Ceph Mark, always spell and capitalize the Ceph Mark exactly as shown in the list of Ceph Marks provided above.
- Use the Ceph Mark only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb, and never in the plural or possessive form.
- When using the Ceph Mark logos, use only approved artwork, as Red Hat may designate from time to time in the list of Ceph Marks above.
- If you are using a Ceph Mark logo on your Site, there must exist a minimum spacing of 25 pixels between each side of the logo and other graphic or textual elements on your Site.
- All permitted uses of the Ceph Marks must identify the Marks as being trademarks of Red Hat using the following standard trademark attribution statement:
  - “[TRADEMARK] is a trademark or registered trademark of Red Hat, Inc. or its subsidiaries in the United States and other countries.”

## Things You Cannot Do:

- Do not modify the Ceph Marks. Do not remove, distort, or alter any element of a Ceph Mark. This includes modifying a Ceph Mark, for example, by hyphenation, abbreviation, or combination with any other words. Do not shorten or create acronyms or initialisms out of the Ceph Marks.
- Do not display a Ceph Mark as the most prominent element on your Site.
- Do not display a Ceph Mark in any manner that implies a relationship or affiliation with, or sponsorship or endorsement by, Red Hat, or that can be reasonably interpreted to suggest editorial content has been authored by, or represents the views or opinions of, Red Hat or Red Hat personnel.
- Do not display a Ceph Mark on any Site that promotes, contains or displays:
  - Content related to nudity, pornography, child abuse, molestation, racial intolerance, advocacy against any individual, group or organization, excessive profanity, hacking or cracking, gambling, casinos, illicit drugs or drug paraphernalia; adult, mature, violent, graphic, or gory themes; or material that otherwise appeals to the prurient interest;
  - Sales of beer, malt liquor beverages, hard alcohol, tobacco or tobacco-related products, prescription drugs, weapons or ammunition (e.g. firearms, firearm components, fighting knives, or stun guns);
  - Trademark and copyright infringements (e.g., Sites devoted to selling fake handbags or bootleg DVDs, or promoting illegal file downloads, fake documents, and cheating services);
  - Content enabling a consumer to evade the law, education systems, or other good-faith arrangements, or regarding programs that compensate users for clicking ads or offers, performing searches, surfing websites, or reading emails; or
  - Content that is illegal, promotes illegal activity, or infringes on the legal rights of others (including any content that violates DMCA anti-circumvention prohibitions).
- Do not display a Ceph Mark in a manner that is misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable (as shall be determined by Red Hat in its sole discretion, which determination shall be communicated to you at the contact information listed on your Site or at the WHOIS information in your Site’s domain name registration, including any contact information listed for an anonymous registration service.)
- Do not display a Ceph Mark on a Site that violates any law or regulation.
- Do not incorporate Ceph Marks into your own product names, service names, trademarks, logos, domain names, social media identifiers, or company names.

- Do not apply to register or register any term comprised or consisting of in whole or in part the Ceph Marks or any confusingly similar mark as trademarks, service marks, corporate names, trade names or domain names, second-level domain names, Internet keywords, metatags, or trigger words to lead to a website.
- Do not use Ceph Marks in a way that suggests a common, descriptive, or generic meaning.
