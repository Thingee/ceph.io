## Bloomberg: Fostering a vibrant Ceph community at Ceph Days NYC

On Tuesday, February 21, 2023, Bloomberg hosted Ceph Days NYC. This day-long
event was held at the Bloomberg Park Avenue office in New York City, and was
dedicated to sharing knowledge about Ceph. Roughly fifty members of the open
source Ceph community came together for a dozen presentations related to Ceph’s
roadmap, tools, and use cases.

Speakers included operators, developers, and researchers from Canonical,
SoftIron, Bloomberg, IBM, Clyso, and Platina.

Frank Yang of Platina shared the lessons that he learned when he worked in
partnership with a major American sports league, using Ceph to archive a large
and irreplaceable cache of videotaped live event data that had been compiled
over decades.

Federico Lucifredi and Sage Mctaggart of the Ceph Storage team at IBM discussed
and explained various methods of hardening Ceph storage.

Bloomberg was especially pleased to host Dan van der Ster, who is CERN’s Data
and Architecture lead and a member of the team that won the Nobel Prize for
discovering the Higgs boson. During his talk, van der Ster reviewed the past
decade of his team’s use of Ceph at CERN. He provided a wide-ranging account of
the challenges of integrating Ceph into research lab hardware and working
through bugs in CERN’s compression library, and he recounted the story of one
particularly harrowing eight-hour day when he learned the importance of
spreading data across multiple Ceph clusters.

Finally, event attendees joined a networking reception dedicated to fostering
the Ceph community.

“Running stuff at scale is a complex task,” van der Ster said at the conclusion
of his talk, “and it’s important to collaborate with other organizations and
individuals who have experience.” We couldn’t agree more.

We look forward to upcoming opportunities to bring together this varied and
dedicated group of Ceph users to learn from each other and to discuss and shape
the future of this open source project.

We will share details of features released across components in the latest Ceph release, Quincy, and explain how this release is different from previous Ceph releases. The talk will also provide a sneak peek into features being planned for the next Ceph release, Reef.

<p>
NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMeoF) is a widely adopted, de facto standard in remote block storage access. Ceph clients use the RADOS protocol to access RBD images, but there are good reasons to enable access via NVMeoF: to allow existing NVMeoF storage users to easily migrate to Ceph and to enable the use of NVMeoF offloading hardware. This talk presents our effort to provide native NVMeoF support for Ceph. We discuss some of the challenges, including multi-pathing for fault tolerance and performance.

The new generation of hybrid cloud provides a common platform across all your cloud, on-premises, and edge environments. That means you can skill once, build once, and manage from a single pane of glass. That also implies platform needs to support diverse workloads and different level of maturity in management skills. In this presentation, we will cover the open source projects and proposals to enhance Ceph's consumability and manageability to enable Ceph in more environments.

<strong>100 Years of Sports on Ceph</strong>
<p>
Working together with a major American sports league, we built a multi-site 40
PB active archive housing over 100 years of game video and audio assets by
using Ceph as the foundational storage technology. Along the way, we learned many
lessons about architecting, deploying, and operationalizing Ceph from the
vantage point of a large, modern, and rapidly growing media company. We would
like to share our experience and learnings with the community to help others
traveling a similar road.

   <td><strong>Ceph Telemetry - Observability in Action</strong>
<p>
To increase product observability and robustness, Ceph’s telemetry module allows users to automatically report anonymized data about their clusters. Ceph’s telemetry backend runs tools that analyze this data to help developers understand how Ceph is used and what problems users may be experiencing. In this session we will overview the various aspects of Ceph’s upstream telemetry and its benefits for users, and explore how telemetry can be deployed independently as a tool for fleet observability.

   <td><strong>Why We Built A “Message-Driven Telemetry System At Scale” Ceph Cluster</strong>
<p>
Ceph’s Prometheus module provides performance counter metrics via the ceph-mgr component. While this works well for smaller installations, it can be problematic to put metric workloads into ceph-mgr at scale. Ceph is just one component of our internal S3 product. We also need to gather telemetry data about space, objects per bucket, buckets per tenancy, etc., as well as telemetry from a software-defined distributed quality of service (QoS) system which is not natively supported by Ceph.

   <td><strong>Introducing Sibench: A New Open Source Benchmarking Tool Optimized for Ceph</strong>
<p>
Benchmarking Ceph has always been a complex task - there are lots of tools but many have drawbacks and are written for more general-purpose use. For Ceph we need to benchmark Librados, RBD, CephFS, and RGW and each of these protocols has unique challenges and typical deployment scenarios. Not only that, Ceph works better at scale and so we need to ensure that we can build a benchmarking system that will also scale and be able to generate an adequate load at large scale.

   <td><strong>Optimizing RGW Object Storage Mixed Media through Storage Classes and Lua Scripting</strong>
<p>
Ceph enables flexible and scalable object storage of unstructured data for a wide variety of workloads. RGW (RADOS GateWay) deployments experience a wide variety of object sizes and must balance workload, cost, and performance requirements. S3 storage classes are an established way to steer data onto underlying media that meet specific resilience, cost, and performance requirements. One might for example define RGW back end storage classes for SSD or HDD media, non-redundant vs replicated vs erasure coding pools, etc. Diversion of individual objects or entire buckets into a non-default storage class usually requires specific client action. Compliance however can be awkward to request and impossible to enforce, especially in multi-tenant deployments that may include paying customers as well as internal users. This work enables the RGW back end to enforce storage class on uploaded objects based on specific criteria without requiring client actions. For example, one might define a default storage class on performance TLC or Optane media for resource-intensive small S3 objects while assigning larger objects to cost-effective QLC SSD media.

<p>
In 2013, the data storage team at CERN began investigating Ceph to solve an emerging problem: how to provide reliable, flexible, future-proof storage for our growing on-premises OpenStack cloud. Beginning with a humble 3PB cluster, the infrastructure has grown to support the entire lab, with 50PB of storage across multiple data centres used across a variety of use-cases ranging from basic IT apps, databases, HPC, cloud storage, and others.

   <td><strong>An Introduction to MicroCeph</strong>
   <p>Building up a Ceph cluster can be a bit tricky and time consuming, especially if it’s just for testing or a small home lab. To make this much easier, we’ve started working on microceph.  It's a snap package that uses a small management daemon that allows for very easy clustering of multiple systems which, combined with an easy bootstrap process, allows for setting up a Ceph cluster in just a few minutes!

Ceph was originally designed to fill a need for a distributed file system within scientific computing environments but has since grown to become a dominant **unified** software-defined distribute storage system. This talk will cover the new development of an SQLite Virtual File System (VFS) on top of Ceph's distributed object store (RADOS). I will show how SQL can now be run on Ceph for both its internal use and for new application storage requirements.

<p>
Over the last few years, we have been gaining experience with Rook in production. One of our challenges was to implement dynamic resource management between 50+ Ceph clusters. Kubernetes events dynamically and fully automatically distribute loads and capacity between Ceph clusters. This is done by removing single or multiple Ceph nodes from Ceph clusters while ensuring data integrity at all times. In the next step, the released Ceph nodes are integrated into other Ceph clusters as needed.
