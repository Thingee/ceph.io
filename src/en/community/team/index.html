            Mike is the Ceph Community Manager at Red Hat. Being a contributing member of OpenStack since 2010, he has served as a core
            developer for the OpenStack block storage project Cinder and as a PTL for the Kilo and Liberty releases. During some of this
            time, he worked for DreamHost in helping with their OpenStack public cloud, one of the first large production deployments of
            Ceph, and helping with integrating a variety of block storage solutions like Ceph in Cinder. He later joined the OpenStack
            Foundation to help with the success of cross-project initiatives and the overall quality and health of the project and
            community.

            When Mike is not trying to make a computer work, he can be found: dancing, getting his hair done, playing with modular
            synthesizers, and doing karaoke for your entertainment.
