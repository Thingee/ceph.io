After several months, we have an important update for the argonaut v0.48.x series.  This release contains a **critical fix that can prevent data loss or corruption** in a power loss or kernel panic situation.  There are also several fixes for the OSDs and for the radosgw.  We recommend all v0.48.x users upgrade.

Notes on upgrading:

- If you are using the undocumented ceph-disk-prepare and ceph-disk-activate tools, they have several new features and some additional functionality. Please review the changes in behavior carefully before upgrading.
- The .deb packages now require xfsprogs.

Notable changes since v0.48.2:

- filestore: fix op\_seq write order (fixes journal replay after power loss)
- osd: fix occasional indefinitely hung “slow” request
- osd: fix encoding for pool\_snap\_info\_t when talking to pre-v0.48 clients
