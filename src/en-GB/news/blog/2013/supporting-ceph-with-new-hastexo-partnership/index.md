Today, I am excited to announce our partnership with [hastexo](http://www.hastexo.com/) who provides Ceph-related professional services world-wide. We have been working closely with hastexo for some time, including collaboration on the development of new Ceph courseware for new [Inktank training courses](http://www.inktank.com/ceph-training/) that are now available.

hastexo is a professional services company located in Austria and serving customers on five continents. The demand for Ceph services and support in Europe continues to grow. About 43% of the [ceph.com](http://ceph.com/) traffic comes from Europe. We have seen a tremendous response to our participation in several European events, including the recent World Hosting Days in Germany. We are lucky to have hastexo on board as partner to help enable organizations around the world to adopt Ceph. [hastexo](http://www.hastexo.com/) has been an active part of the Ceph community for nearly two years. Our collaboration with hastexo encompasses architectural consulting, systems design and implementation, and courseware development for training on Ceph. As an independent professional services organization, hastexo advises its customers on the suitability and applicability of open-source distributed storage software, tailored to individual customer requirements. This includes Ceph technology, where hastexo has unique expertise guiding customers in Ceph systems design for high availability and cloud applications.

hastexo has enabled us to get new Ceph training into the market faster. hastexo’s insight into courseware development and methodology is a great asset to our own training team. The three new classes that are now available are: Ceph Fundamentals, Ceph Operations and Tuning, and Ceph and OpenStack.
