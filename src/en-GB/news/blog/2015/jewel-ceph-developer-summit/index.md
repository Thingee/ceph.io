[![](images/Ceph_Logo_Standard_RGB_Reversed_120411_fa.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uySM4AVDAio/VOy0ER59bSI/AAAAAAAAFUc/ygQ_FBtxt6k/s1600/Ceph_Logo_Standard_RGB_Reversed_120411_fa.png)The next (virtual) Ceph Developer Summit is coming. The agenda has been finally announced for the 1.and 2. of July 2015. The fist day starts at 07:00 PDT (16:00 CEST) and the second day starts at 18:00 PDT on 2. July or rather 03:00 CEST on 03.July.Â 

  

I have submitted a blueprint to discuss and afterwards starting to working on the "[CephX brute-force protection through auto-blacklisting](http://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/wiki/Security_-_CephX_brute-force_protection_through_auto-blacklisting)" topic from my talk in Vancouver to improve the security of Ceph. But there are many other interesting blueprints on the list. You can find the full agenda and blueprints we will discuss [here](http://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/wiki/CDS_Jewel).
