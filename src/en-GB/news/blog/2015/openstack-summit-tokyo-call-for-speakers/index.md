The next [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/) will take place in Tokyo, Japan from 27-30 October 2015. The Call for Speaker period is open since some days and will close on July 15th, 2015, 11:59 PM PDT (July 16th, 08:59 CEST).

  

You can submit your presentations [here](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/call-for-speakers/). I myself work currently on a proposal to speak about OpenStack and Ceph HA aspects.
