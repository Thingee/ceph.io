Recently i have been playing around Ceph calamari which is a management and monitoring system for Ceph storage cluster. It provides a beautiful Dashboard User Interface that makes Ceph cluster monitoring amazingly simple and handy.

# History

- Calamari was developed by InkTank and was provided as a product offering under InkTank Ceph Enterprise ( ICE ) to their enterprise customers.

- Later when RedHat acquired InkTank , [Calamari](https://github.com/ceph/calamari) was open sourced by RedHat

# Next Step

To deploy Calamari in your environment you need to build it from source into direct installable packages ( RPM , DEB ). However building calamari packages is a daunting task, follow [Official Documentation](http://ceph.com/calamari/docs/development/building_packages.html) and be ready for extra troubleshooting.
