We can’t stop talking about the engineering feat that is [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/). We’re very proud of having started [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) (the software that powers our cloud offering) open sourcing it for the world to enjoy, and we’re proud that [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en) has taken the lead to make Ceph even more powerful.

The latest instance of us tooting our own DreamObjects horn was last week in Cupertino at [Red Hat Storage Day](http://redhatstorage.redhat.com/2015/10/02/cephs-on-the-move-and-coming-to-a-city-near-you/), where DreamHost’s VP of Cloud and Development, Jonathan LaCour, and Cloud Systems Engineer, Kobi Laredo, exhibited our Ceph cluster in all its glory. They shared juicy details with an audience of about 75 people willing to hear about how DreamObject’s cluster is managed and monitored. Our engineering and operations teams take great pride in the speed and reliability achieved with DreamObjects, and they can’t stop talking about it.

Take a look at the slides from Jonathan and Kobi, and if you have any questions for them, please leave a comment below!

Your next chance to meet us is in Tokyo, Japan, where our team will be present in full force at the [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/), where we’ll be happy to talk more about using DreamCompute and DreamObjects to deploy applications in our cloud. Stay tuned for more content and make sure to check our [cloud knowledge base](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Category:Cloud) for inspiration.
