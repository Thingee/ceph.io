Conference season is heating up again - next week [Kai Wagner](https://github.com/capri1989) (co-founder of the openATTIC project) and myself will be at [SUSECON in Prague](http://www.susecon.com/), to [talk about](https://susecon17.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=119040) how to manage a Ceph cluster with SUSE's Salt-based [DeepSea](https://github.com/SUSE/DeepSea) project and openATTIC 3.x.

SUSECON marks an important milestone in our project's history - it was at last year's SUSECON in Washington, DC at which the [acquisition of the openATTIC project and team](http://openattic.org/posts/openattic-joins-suse/) by SUSE was announced.

A lot has changed in the meanwhile - among other things, the team has grown significantly ([Ricardo Marques](https://github.com/ricardoasmarques) and [Tiago Melo](https://github.com/tspmelo) from Portugal and [Volker Theile](https://github.com/votdev) from Germany joined us), we [switched from Mercurial to git](http://openattic.org/posts/openattic-code-repository-migrated-to-git/) and changed the project's focus in version 3.x into becoming a [scalable, feature-rich Ceph management tool](http://openattic.org/posts/implementing-a-more-scalable-storage-management-framework-in-openattic-30/).

We look forward to show off what we have worked on and achieved in the meanwhile. If you haven't done so already - make sure to [register for SUSECON](https://susecon17.smarteventscloud.com/portal/login.ww) right away! See you next week!
