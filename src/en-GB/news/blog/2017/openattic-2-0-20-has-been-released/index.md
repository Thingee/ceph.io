It is our great pleasure to announce the release of openATTIC version 2.0.20. This is a minor bugfix release, which also provides a number of small selected improvements, e.g. in the WebUI (styling, usability), installation and logging (now adds PID and process name to logs). Furthermore, we updated our documentation - especially the installation instructions as well as the developer documentation.
