I presented a short talk at the [2017 openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC17) on Linux kernel testing using [Rapido](https://github.com/rapido-linux/rapido).  
  
There were many other interesting talks during the conference, all of which can be viewed on the oSC 2017 [media site](https://media.ccc.de/b/conferences/osc17).  
A video of my presentation is available below, and on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XTEGe0lG3yc). Many thanks to the organisers and [sponsors](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC17#sponsors) for putting on a great event.
