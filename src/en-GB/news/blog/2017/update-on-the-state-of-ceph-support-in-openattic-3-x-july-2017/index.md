A little bit less than a month ago Lenz Grimmer [gave an overview](http://openattic.org/posts/the-state-of-ceph-support-in-openattic-3x-june-2017/) about the current state of our development in openATTIC 3.x.

We made a lot of good progress in the meanwhile and I'm very proud to announce that NFS Gateway Management, RGW Bucket Management and Prometheus/Grafana made it into our newest [openATTIC 3.3.0](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/filesystems:openATTIC:3.x/openattic) release as well as a lot of UI usability improvements.
