We are happy to announce version 3.5.0 of openATTIC. With this release we continued integrating Ceph Luminous features. One of those features is the possibility to edit Ceph pools - the size of PGs can be changed and pool applications can be enabled or disabled. Furthermore we integrated the functionality to manage OSD properties (for example "no out") cluster-wide. The Grafana dashboard got an update as well: we added more statistics for Rados Gateway users and buckets ([contribution to DeepSea](https://github.com/SUSE/DeepSea/pull/626)).

When using the "Striping"-feature for an RBD there will be two more fields in the UI "striping unit" and "striping count" which can be set. This feature also comes with helpful information for the user while editing or changing values.

As usual we improved the usability of our UI and fixed some minor bugs. Also our documentation now contains a [troubleshooting guide](http://docs.openattic.org/en/latest/install_guides/troubleshooting.html).
