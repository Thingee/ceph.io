We are proud to announce Version 3.5.2 of openATTIC.

Today, we broke our regular release cycle, with a good reason. After we published version 3.5.1, we found a hand full of bugs that, from our point of view, could frustrate the user while managing their cluster with openATTIC.

For example, in this version we prevent the user from deleting buckets that are referenced/used by NFS etc.

Furthermore, due to changes in the latest Ceph version, it wasn't possible to create erasure code profiles anymore. This issue has been fixed in this release as well.

Some other minor changes and UI improvements made it also into this release, see the CHANGELOG for further details.
