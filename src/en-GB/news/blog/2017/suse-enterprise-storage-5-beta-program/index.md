[openATTIC 3.x](/posts/the-state-of-ceph-support-in-openattic-3x-june-2017/) will be part of the upcoming SUSE Enterprise Storage 5 release, which is currently in beta testing. It will be based on the upstream Ceph "Luminous" release and will also ship with openATTIC 3.x and Salt/DeepSea for the orchestration, deployment and management.

If you would like to take a look at this release and help us with testing the new functionality provided by openATTIC and DeepSea without having to assemble the various pieces manually, please join our beta test program by following the instructions outlined on the [SUSE Enterprise Storage 5 Beta Program](https://www.suse.com/betaprogram/storage-beta/) web page.

We look forward to your feedback!
