We're happy to announce version 3.6.2 of openATTIC!

Version 3.6.2 is the second bugfix release of the 3.6 stable branch, containing fixes for multiple issues that were reported by users.

One new feature that we want to point out is the internationalization. openATTIC has been translated to Chinese and German to be present on other markets as well. We are working on other translations, for example Spanish. If you would like to see your native language as part of openATTIC get in touch with us and we guide you how you can contribute and help us with the translation. We also had some packaging changes: Due to new requirements, we now use \_fillupdir RPM macro in our SUSE spec file.

As usual the release comes with several usability enhancements and security improvements. For example we improved the modal deletion dialog in general - instead of just entering "yes" when deleting an item, it is now required to enter the item name itself - so users do not accidentally remove the wrong item. Furthermore we fixed incorrect API endpoint URLs for RGW buckets. We also adapted/changed some test cases - e.g. e2e tests were converted into Angular unit tests.
