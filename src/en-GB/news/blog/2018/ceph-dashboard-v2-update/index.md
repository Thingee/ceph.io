It's been a little over a month now since we reached [Milestone 1](http://openattic.org/posts/the-initial-ceph-dashboard-v2-pull-request-has-been-merged/) (feature parity with Dashboard v1), which was [merged](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/20103) into the Ceph master branch on 2018-03-06.

After the initial merge, we had to resolve a few build and packaging related issues, to streamline the ongoing development, testing and packaging of the new dashboard as part of the main Ceph project.

With these teething problems out of the way, the team has started working on several topics in parallel. A lot of these are "groundwork/foundation" kind of tasks, e.g. adding UI components and backend functionality that pave the way to enable the additional user-visible management features.

In the meanwhile, we have submitted over 80 additional [pull requests](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Adashboard), of which more than 60 have been merged already.

In this post, I'd like to summarize some of the highlights and notable improvements we're currently working on or that have been added to the code base already. This is by no means a complete list - it's more a subjective selection of changes that caught my attention.

It's also noteworthy that we've already received a number of pull requests from Ceph community members outside of the original openATTIC team that started this project - we're very grateful for the support and look forward to future contributions!
