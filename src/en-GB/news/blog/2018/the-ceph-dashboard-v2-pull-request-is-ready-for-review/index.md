About a month ago, we [shared the news](http://openattic.org/posts/ceph-manager-dashboard-v2/) that we started working on a replacement for the Ceph dashboard, to set the stage for creating a full-fledged, built-in web-base management tool for Ceph.

We're happy to announce that we have now finalized the preparations for the [initial pull request](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/20103), which marks our first milestone in this venture: reaching feature parity with the existing dashboard.
