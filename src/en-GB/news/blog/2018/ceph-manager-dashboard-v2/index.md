The original [Ceph Manager Dashboard](https://ceph.com/community/new-luminous-dashboard/) that was introduced in Ceph "Luminous" started out as a simple, read-only view into various run-time information and performance data of a Ceph cluster, without authentication or any administrative functionality.

However, as it turns out, there is a growing demand for adding more web-based management capabilities, to make it easier for administrators that prefer a WebUI to manage Ceph over the command line. Sage Weil also touched upon this topic in the [Ceph Developer monthly call in December](https://youtu.be/YNfp_4S7mYE?t=28m39s) and created an etherpad with some [ideas for improvement](http://pad.ceph.com/p/mimic-dashboard).

After learning about this, we approached Sage and John Spray from the Ceph project and offered our help to implement the missing functionality. Based on our experiences in developing the Ceph support in openATTIC, we think we have a lot to offer in the form of code and experience in creating a Ceph administration and monitoring UI.
