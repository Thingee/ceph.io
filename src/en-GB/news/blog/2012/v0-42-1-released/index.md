This release contains a few key fixes for v0.42:

- fixed osdmap encoding for older clients.  In particular, v0.41 versions of things like librbd won’t crash talking to v0.42 daemons.
- ceph-dencoder and man page are included in the rpm and deb
- ceph.spec file is fixed

If you are upgrading, upgrade to v0.42.2, not v0.42.  Ignore v0.42.1: I forgot to include the encoding fix and didn’t notice until after I’d pushed the tag.
