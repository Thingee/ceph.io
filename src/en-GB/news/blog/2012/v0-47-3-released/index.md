This is a bugfix release with one major fix and a few small ones:

- osd: disable use of the FIEMAP ioctl by default as its use was leading to corruption for RBD users
- a few minor compile/build/specfile fixes

I was going to wait for v0.48, but that is still several days away.  If you are using RBD in production, you should either add ‘filestore fiemap = false’ to your ceph.conf file or upgrade.

You can get this release from the usual places, with the exception of Debian sid and wheezy packages; the upstream repos were sufficiently broken to make pbuilder cranky so I left them out.
