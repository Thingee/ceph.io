Weâ€™ve released v0.32. Notable in this release:

- common: perfcounter instrumentation now accessible via unix domain socket
- mon: dump cluster state in json format
- client: fix a few stalls, ref count links, clustered mds misbehaviors
- mds: many many clustering fixes, getting closer
- mds: fix for O\_APPEND behavior
- osd: bug fixes in clone overlap tracking, accounting
- osd: bug fixes in recovery code when clones/snapshots are present
- radosgw: multithreaded fastcgi mode
- radosgw: many small fixes
- radosgw: consistent cache of bucket objects (ACLs)
- CodingStyle document

For v0.33, we are working on more MDS clustering issues, collectd plugins (for per-daemon and cluster stats), better management of the internal directory structure on OSDs to facilitate PG splitting (scaling of object pools), the radosgw, and of course teuthology, our qa framework.
