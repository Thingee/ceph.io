The v0.21.3 release is out. Â Changes since v0.21.2 include:

- cfuse: fix readdir for large directories
- cfuse: fixed truncation (now passes fsx)
- radosgw: fixed some info leakage between users
- radosgw: support wildcard dns for bucketname.domain/object access
- mon: less log noise
- mds: fixed snap bug with directory renames
- mds: fixed journal replay bug with reconnecting clients
- mds: fixed journal replay bug with inconsistent lock state, subsequent crash

Nothing groundbreaking, but v0.21.2 users experiencing any problems should upgrade.

This will likely be the last v0.21 series release; v0.22 is due in about two weeks (see the [roadmap](http://tracker.newdream.net/projects/ceph/roadmap)).
