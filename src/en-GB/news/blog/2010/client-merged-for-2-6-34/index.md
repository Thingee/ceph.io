Linus merged the Ceph for 2.6.34 this morning, which means the next kernel release will be able to mount a Ceph file system without any additional patches or modifications.

This is a pretty big milestone for us, and weâ€™re excited! The next few weeks will be spent hammering out client bugs and polishing the v0.20 release.
