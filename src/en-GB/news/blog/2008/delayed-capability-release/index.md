The Ceph MDS server issues “capabilities” to clients to grant them permission to read or write objects for a particular file. I’ve added a delayed release of capabilities after a file is closed, as many workloads will quickly reopen the same file. In that case, we can re-use our existing capabilities (and be assured by the metadata leases that we’re correctly resolved the pathname to the correct inode) without any additional MDS interaction. This is a big win for, surprisingly, find, which has a pretty peculiar access pattern when descending out of directories:

> open("..", O\_RDONLY|O\_NOFOLLOW)         = 4
> fchdir(4)                               = 0
> close(4)                                = 0
> open("..", O\_RDONLY|O\_NOFOLLOW)         = 4
> fchdir(4)                               = 0
> close(4)                                = 0
> fchdir(3)                               = 0
> open(".", O\_RDONLY|O\_NOFOLLOW)          = 4
> fchdir(4)                               = 0
> close(4)                                = 0
> close(1)                                = 0

The explicit open was almost doubling the number of MDS ops. After adding delayed cap release, the workload (as seen by the MDS), now looks pretty tidy:

> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.22 open /a) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.23 readdir #10000000000) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.24 open /a/b) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.25 readdir #10000000001) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.26 open /a/b/c) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.27 readdir #10000000002) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.28 open /a/b/d) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.29 readdir #10000000003) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.30 open /a/e) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_request(client0.31 readdir #10000000004) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_file\_caps(ack ino 10000000000 seq 2 caps \[ \] wanted\[ \] size 0/0) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_file\_caps(ack ino 10000000001 seq 2 caps \[ \] wanted\[ \] size 0/0) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_file\_caps(ack ino 10000000002 seq 2 caps \[ \] wanted\[ \] size 0/0) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_file\_caps(ack ino 10000000003 seq 2 caps \[ \] wanted\[ \] size 0/0) ====
> mds0 <== client0 ==== client\_file\_caps(ack ino 10000000004 seq 2 caps \[ \] wanted\[ \] size 0/0) ====

..where the last 5 message release the capabilities a few seconds later.
