City Network, a leading global supplier of cloud services based on OpenStack, today announced that the international engineering and construction company Drake and Scull International PJSC has chosen City Network as its cloud partner. With a business history stretching back 135 years and operations across the globe, Drake and Scull has made a strategic decision to move all of its group IT services to City Networks OpenStack based public cloud platform City Cloud. Drake and Scull, headquartered in Dubai, will use the City Cloud node in Dubai for its operations.

Drake and Scull is increasingly digitalising its operations, finding new and smart ways to enhance efficiency and streamline its processes. Finding a reliable and innovative cloud partner for their IT operations was therefore a natural step. The company has a vast number of different IT systems and platforms. City Cloud proved to be a perfect match as its solution is based on the open platform OpenStack, which makes it easy to incorporate different systems into a single platform. The fact that City Network has a node in Dubai also played a key role, as this ensures that the data is kept within the country.

Drake and Scull and City Network worked in close collaboration to transfer the current IT operations to City Cloud at the beginning of 2019.

“_We are delighted to collaborate with such a first-rate company_,” says Eyad Saleh, Managing Director of City Network in the Middle East. “_Interest in our cloud services is growing in the region, driven by increased momentum in the digital transformation and the fact that we have a point of presence in Dubai._”

City Network was one of the first cloud service providers to enter the UEA when it created its local hub for IaaS almost two years ago. The agreement with Drake and Scull is significant both in terms of revenue and recognition in the industry.

“_The contract is an important milestone for City Networks operations in UAE as one of the major enterprises in the region is using City Cloud as a base for its IT infrastructure_,” says Johan Christenson, CEO and founder of City Network. “_In all markets and industries, the transformation towards digitalised business processes is a top priority and a scalable and programable IT infrastructure is essential if this transition is to succeed_,” Johan concludes.
