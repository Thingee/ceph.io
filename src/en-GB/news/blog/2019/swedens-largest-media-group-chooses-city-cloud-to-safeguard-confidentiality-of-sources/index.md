City Network, a leading global supplier of cloud services based on OpenStack, has initiated a collaboration with Bonnier News. The media Group, which is Sweden’s largest, will use City Network’s IaaS solution City Cloud as a means of future-proofing its IT infrastructure for material which requires source protection. Bonnier News reaches more than 3.5 million users\* every day through all of its media channels including the newspapers Dagens Nyheter, Dagens Industri and Expressen.

_“Our core business is news, and part of our responsibility lies in safeguarding the privacy of our readers and sources. Sweden has the world’s toughest requirements for source confidentiality,”_ says Fredrik Ögren, Infrastructure Director at Bonnier News.

The Group is proactive in digitalizing everything that can be digitalized and in recent years has actively used both hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud solutions. Therefore, it was important to find an infrastructure solution to match the opportunities of digitalization at scale, while also complying with legislative requirements surrounding source protection.

Following an evaluation, City Network’s OpenStack-based Public Cloud service was chosen. Bonnier News has previously used City Cloud to store large amounts of data from some of its TV broadcasts.

_“City Network represents a combination of values that are important to us. They are a Swedish supplier with data centers located in Sweden, where the service is also run from, and this enables us to comply with the requirements of source protection legislation. At the same time, the company has a global footprint, which meets our requirements for data management outside of Sweden. Furthermore, the service is built on open standards and open source which aligns well with our philosophy for openness and transparency,”_ says Fredrik Ögren.

Bonnier News will use City Cloud from both Stockholm locations in order to comply with the company’s rigorous demands for redundancy and security.

_“The fact that Sweden’s largest media Group has chosen City Cloud as a basis for its secure infrastructure for material which requires source protection is strong proof of the high degree of security offered by the service. At the same time, Bonnier News will benefit from all of the additional advantages of running workloads in our cloud in terms of flexibility, scalability and cost efficiency,”_ concludes Johan Christenson, CEO and founder of City Network.
