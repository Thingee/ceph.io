Data and communications must be protected from backdoors and viruses that could compromise them. Viruses introduce themselves into computer systems and may destroy or exploit the data they contain. Backdoors are deliberately inserted by the designers of a software application for the purpose of gaining access to the machines running the application. Both viruses and backdoors allow the people who control them to do things like extract confidential information. The risk is real: in July 2020, the company Orange confirmed they were targeted by a malware that leaked data belonging to its business customers.
