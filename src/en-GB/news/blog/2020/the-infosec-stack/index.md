## About The \[InfoSec\] Stack 

In The \[InfoSec\] Stack, [Daniel Gustafsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-gustafsson-73727120/) and [Kim Hindart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimhindart/) are analyzing current events and cases, share our experience in IT security, leadership, and workplace culture. We also discuss how new privacy laws and directives affect both businesses and individuals.

What is information security? What are the requirements for regulatory compliance, and what does it mean? Are there any new laws that will affect our continued ability to drive digital transformation? Why will business culture be a decisive factor in making our IT strategy work?

Many things affect our digital stack right now, and it is not always easy to know how to act. If you also find this a bit challenging, this is the podcast for you.
