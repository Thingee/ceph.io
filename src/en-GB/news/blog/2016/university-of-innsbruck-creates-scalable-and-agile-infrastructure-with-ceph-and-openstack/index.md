> In my team we are used to constantly reinventing ourselves and our services, to stay competitive with the market and satisfy our costumers growing demand on mobility of data and services. Private clouds based on Openstack and Ceph help us keep data safe, while offering cloud services similar to global cloud providers Google, Amazon and Microsoft. hastexo is supporting us in a great way to drive this change.

The [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at/) is one of the largest universities in Austria with more than 28,000 students currently enrolled. To extend and improve IT services offered to staff and students, the institution has decided to adopt Ceph as its preferred Software Defined Storage (SDS) solution, and OpenStack as its cloud platform. hastexo is supporting the university with [design and architecture consulting](https://www.hastexo.com/services/architecture/), [implementation services](https://www.hastexo.com/services/implementation/) and [training](https://www.hastexo.com/services/training/) around [Ceph](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/ceph/) and [OpenStack](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/openstack/).

Open source technology is key for the university's data center operations. This includes platforms like Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, the Puppet system automation and deployment framework, and the Foreman lifecycle manager. While working with hastexo, the university identified a need for improved integration of Puppet and Foreman with Ceph, and hastexo's team promptly delivered. In best open-source community fashion, hastexo built on work previously done by community developers on the puppet-ceph framework, working upstream and contributing the improvements back to the community.

Throughout the process from the early stages to the actual implementation, the university's data center operations team commended hastexo's extensive knowledge around Ceph and OpenStack. They especially appreciated hastexo's ability to provide solutions tailored specifically to the university's use-case.

hastexo will continue to assist the university in the deployment and optimization of open source cloud technology.
