The terrific trio composed of [Sébastien Han](https://twitter.com/sebastien_han), [Sean Cohen](https://twitter.com/SeanCohen_RH) and yours truly descended on Austin this week for the recurring ritual of the OpenStack Summit. Our mission: to [save the galaxy](https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/7280) – or at least your data. Séb and Sean covered architectural options for disaster recovery in OpenStack and I introduced the capabilities provided by Ceph’s newfangled [RBD Mirroring](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/rbd-mirroring/) feature in last week’s [10.2.0](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/release-notes/#v10.2.0-jewel) (“Jewel”) release.

**UPDATE**: The recording of our OpenStack Summit session is now live on the OpenStack Foundation’s YouTube channel.

Our slides are [available as a PDF](http://people.redhat.com/%7Eflucifre/talks/Protecting%20the%20Galaxy%20-%20Multi-Region%20Disaster%20Recovery%20with%20OpenStack%20and%20Ceph.pdf) and can be viewed inline below — we are including even our backup slides for additional Gory detail ™ value:

See you all in Barça this fall!
