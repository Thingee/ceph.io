![A Gentle Introduction to Ceph](images/a-gentle-introduction-to-ceph-exported-1024x830.png)I told a little story about [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) today in the [sysadmin miniconf](http://sysadmin.miniconf.org/programme16.html) at [linux.conf.au 2016](http://lcabythebay.org.au/). Simon and Ewen have already put a copy of my slides up on the miniconf web site, but for bonus posterity you can get them from [here](http://ourobengr.com/wp-uploads/2016/02/A-Gentle-Introduction-to-Ceph.odp) also. For some more detail, check out Lars’ [SUSE Enterprise Storage – Design and Performance for Ceph](https://www.susecon.com/doc/2015/sessions/TUT20074.pdf) slides from [SUSECon 2015](https://www.susecon.com/archive-2015.html) and [Software-defined Storage: Sizing and Performance](https://www.suse.com/company/newsletter/insider.html#article1).

Update (2016-02-07): The video of the talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xoYFGkFTkM).
