[Last week I blogged](https://www.hastexo.com/blogs/florian/2016/01/29/new-hastexo-academy/) about our brand new hastexo Academy platform, and today we're announcing our first course as open for business. In _content,_ **[Ceph Distributed Storage Fundamentals (HX212)](https://store.hastexo.com/catalogue/ceph-distributed-storage-fundamentals_3/)** is quite similar to our extremely popular [HX112](https://www.hastexo.com/services/academy/hx112/) face-to-face class — in _delivery,_ it couldn't be any more different.

## Learning technology, 21st century style

[HX212](https://academy.hastexo.com/courses/course-v1:hastexo+hx212+201602/about) is, of course, based on your hastexo Academy [Open edX](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/openedx/) platform. And this platform enables us to radically depart from what you usually know from learning platforms. We don't have a talking head explaining things to you. We don't subject you to a video sermon. **We allow you to go through lessons at your own natural pace,** which is likely faster than anything video-based can cover — if you're anything like any other person, you'll read much faster than anyone can talk.

And most importantly, thanks to our awesome hastexo XBlock, we can provide you with **on-demand lab environment at a moment's notice.** You just enter a lab, and magic[1](magic) happens that spins up your very own multi-node cluster, which you can then run your course labs on.

Labs are **highly immersive and realistic:** you'll learn how to spin up a Ceph cluster, MONs and OSDs, how to interact with RADOS, create RBD volumes, deploy radosgw, and even configure CephFS. At the end of each lab, your progress is automatically assessed at the touch of a button, and you get immediate, direct feedback on whether or not you completed the lab successfully. And if at any time you do get stuck or need help, you have a discussion board and a wiki to reach out to your instructor and learning peers.

## Great stuff, brought to you by an awesome team

We're proud to bring you this course as an example of excellent team collaboration. [Adolfo Brandes](https://www.hastexo.com/who/adolfo/) wrote the majority of our XBlock code, the course itself is a collaboration of everyone at hastexo, and [Syed Armani](https://www.hastexo.com/who/syed/) wrote the automated lab assessments.

## Grab it while it's hot!

HX212 is available immediately [from our store](https://store.hastexo.com/catalogue/ceph-distributed-storage-fundamentals_3/) at a list price of €699 (excluding applicable tax[2](tax)) and is on launch sale until the end of the month at €499.

1. OK, it's not real magic. It's completely open source tech we wrote that leverages the awesomeness of OpenStack and Open edX together, [and that anyone can use](//github.com/hastexo/hastexo-xblock). But it's as cool as magic. [↩](magic "Jump back to footnote 1 in the text")
    
2. Yes, tax. This details of this are super complicated and warrant a blog post in and of itself, but if you are based in Europe and you're not a business, we do have to assess VAT. So if you're learning Ceph as part of your job, make sure you get your company to sign off on it, and get the billing address, legal company name, and VATIN from your accounting department. [↩](tax "Jump back to footnote 2 in the text")
