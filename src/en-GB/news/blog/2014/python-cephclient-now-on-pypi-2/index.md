Back on January 1st, I [wrote](http://dmsimard.com/2014/01/01/a-python-client-for-ceph-rest-api/) about my initiative regarding a client for the Ceph REST API made in python.

I’m glad to announce that the client is now available on PyPi and I have just drafted the second release: [v0.1.0.2](https://github.com/dmsimard/python-cephclient#release-notes).

[Check it out](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-cephclient) and let me know what you think !
