This second edition of the CephDay London looks really promising. You should definitely look at the agenda! Talks go from OpenStack to deep performance studies and crossing CephFS news!

Check this out on the [Eventbrite page](http://ceph.com/cephdays/london2/).

  

> I hope to see you there! I don't have any talks, at least for once I'll be watching :-).
