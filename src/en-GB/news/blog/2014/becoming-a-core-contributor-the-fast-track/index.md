Anyone willing to become a better Free Software contributor is invited to attend the next session of [Upstream University](http://upstream-university.org/) in advance of [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/). The training starts January 30th, 2014 in the morning, at a walking distance from [Grand Place in Brussels](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/50.84641/4.35933).

- [Registration is free](http://upstream-university.org/apply/) and requires to [pick a contribution to work on](http://upstream-university.org/course/) in the bug tracker of a Free Software project (it can be any Free Software project)

Participating in Free Software projects is not just about technical skills : there will be informal followups in bars and restaurants afterwards ![:-)](http://dachary.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) This session will be the first to focus on **Core Contributors** and what it takes to become one, based on lessons learnt from [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) and [Ceph](http://ceph.com/).  
  
[Upstream University](http://upstream-university.org/) has trained dozens of Free Software contributors over the past two years, in [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/), [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) and even the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/). Computer science students from universities experienced their first Free Software contribution during the training. But it can also be profitable to more ambitious contributors such as Swami who [introduced VPNaaS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwrhNfhk1HQ&html5=True) in OpenStack during the course of the [Havana](http://www.openstack.org/software/havana/) release in 2013.

I started contributing to [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) in January 2013 and gradually became more involved with activities ranging from answering questions on IRC to leading the addition of a major feature over many months. The lessons from this recent experience and the benefits of being a [Ceph Core Contributor](http://metrics.ceph.com/scm.html) (both from my employer point of view and for myself ) were used to improve the [Upstream University course](http://upstream-university.org/course/) and it will be my pleasure to deliver this session.

For people interested in Ceph, a meetup is organized Friday 31st in the afternoon ( [registration is open](http://www.meetup.com/Ceph-Brussels/events/152786002/) ) immediately after the Upstream University course, at the same location.
