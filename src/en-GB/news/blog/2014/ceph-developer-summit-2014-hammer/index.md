The Ceph Developer Summit (CDS) for the next major Ceph release called Hammer started today some hours ago (2014/10/28). It's again a virtual summit via video conference calls.

  

[![](images/logo.png)](https://wiki.ceph.com/@api/deki/site/logo.png)I've submitted three blueprints:

  

- [Ceph Security hardening](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/Blueprints/Hammer/Ceph_Security_hardening) \[[pad](http://pad.ceph.com/p/hammer-security_and_auth)\]
- [How to make Ceph enterprise ready](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/Blueprints/Hammer/How_to_make_Ceph_enterprise_ready) [\[pad](http://pad.ceph.com/p/hammer-security_and_auth)\]
- [rados: improve ex-/import functionality](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/Blueprints/Hammer/rados%3A_improve_ex-%2F%2Fimport_functionality) \[[pad](http://pad.ceph.com/p/hammer-rados_export_import)\]

We already discussed the Ceph security and enterprise topics. You can find the results/logs in the pad. The sessions are recorded and will be available afterwards.

  

If you are interested in Ceph development: now it's time to join the video conference call. You can find all links, the timetable and blueprints to discuss [here](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/CDS/Hammer_(Oct_2014)). There will be a second track with a lot of interesting discussions tomorrow.

  

If you are interested to work e.g. on the Ceph security topic: check the pad and feel free to contact me.
